I want to receipt 2 float input and 1 operator
main function:
1. get_input() -> accept 2 float number and 1 operator
2. calculate(num1, num2, operator) -> return result
3. display_result(result)
if I insert invalid operator or divided by 0 -> should show error or something

---- we done for the fundamental of calculator ---

then I want to create try/except to make sure we receipt the right input from user
we finished, but I want to separate function into separate files or module
I change my mind XD, I want to refactor when I finish the project!
sorry I am not good at English TT

let's break 5 mins!
